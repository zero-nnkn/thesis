%% usmthesis.cls 2016/12/08 version V1.7.
%%
%% IMPORTANT MESSAGE (Dec 2016)
%% Due to the recent numerous changes requested by IPS, USM to different
%% candidates -- often conflicting even within the same week -- without much
%% consistency nor in black in white, I have found it increasingly difficult
%% to maintain a coherent version. I have therefore decided to provide some
%% options that seem to be favored by IPS on different occasions; but will no
%% longer update the template until an updated formatting guidelines with clear
%% instructions and concrete samples is published.
%%
%% THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER UPDATES UNTIL IPS-USM PUBLISHES AN OFFICIAL
%% UPDATED FORMATTING GUIDELINES WITH CONCRETE, CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS.
%%
%% Individual requests for help to modify this version for your needs will be
%% handled on a case by case basis, depending on my mood, perhaps for a fee.
%% Requests for help to modify past versions will NOT be entertained.
%% Please read http://tex.my/how-to-ask-for-latex-related-help-effectively/.
%%
%% (Yes I'm that tired and frustrated. I know everyone just want to graduate,
%% but I am by now genuinely put off by the tone of some requests with rude
%% attitudes, unclear descriptions, flip-flopping conditions, etc for something
%% that was originally for my own use.)
%%
%% Usmthesis _was_ fun; but it has ceased to be so for me.
%%
%% Submit a git pull request on https://github.com/liantze/usmthesis
%% if you wish to contribute your changes. No timeframe is set for approvals.
%% I cannot check through any edited usmthesis.cls of any version without
%% CVS.
%%
%% Oh and if you'd like to adapt this template (the .cls and/or the .tex) for
%% your institution, that's perfectly fine, but at least keep the license
%% (LPPL 1.3) and the original author (me) won't you? It's just normal decency.
%% THANK you. :-)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% If you prefer -- and have been allowed -- to use
%% Arial, then
%% \documentclass[arial]{usmthesis}
%% It's not really Arial, it's a Helvetica look-alike,
%% but if you're not a designer nor a typographer, you
%% probably can't tell the difference (I can't either)
%%
%% OTHER IMPORTANT OPTIONS:
%% singespacetitle - Make title on cover and title
%%                   page single-spaced.
%%
%% chapnumwords — Make chapter titles be `Chapter One'
%% tocchapnumwords — Make the ToC use `Chaper One' too
%%   (Engineering IPS seems to like the above two settings)
%%
%% tocpage   These options will add a ``Page'' label at the
%% lotpage   top of the Table of Contents, List of Tables,
%% lofpage   List of Figures and List of Plates respectively.
%% loppage   I don't know lah, one moment IPS says must add at
%%           the top of all these lists; one month later say
%%           only the ToC, a few months later say don't add at all.
%%           Find, mix-and-match yourself based on the instrustions you got.
%%
%% tocCAPSfront - Sometimes IPS wants the ``Table of Contents'', ``List of
%%                Figures'', ``Abstract'' etc to be all-caps in the ToC;
%%                sometimes they don't. Use this option to make them ALL CAPS.
%%
%% tocCAPSref - Similar to the above but for the ``References''.
%% tocCAPSapp - Similar to the above but for the ``Appendices''.
\documentclass[
singlespacetitle, % Make title on cover page singlespaced
% chapnumwords,tocchapnumwords,  %% ``Chapter One'' I think Engineering like this
tocpage,  % Put ``Page'' at top of ToC. Add lotpage, lofpage if
          % ``Page'' is also needed for LoT and LoF.
% tocCAPSfront, % Make ``List of Tables'' etc in ToC CAPS
% tocCAPSref, % Make ``References'' in ToC CAPS
% tocCAPSapp, % Make ``Appendices'' in ToC CAPS
